## Background

What makes people in a country happy?

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The report gains global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. This project allows us to gain insight into the state of happiness in the world today.
